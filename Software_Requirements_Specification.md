## 4. System Features
Each system feature is described in detail under its respective use case (UC) section.

### 4.1 UC_001 – Smart Mirror Startup and Display
- **Preconditions**: System is powered and connected to the internet.  
- **Triggers**: User powers on the mirror or motion sensor detects presence.  
- **Main Course**: System boots up, loads configurations, and displays the dashboard.  
- **Alternate Course**: If system is in sleep mode, wakes up automatically.  
- **Exception Handling**: If boot fails, system logs errors and reboots.  

### 4.2 UC_002 – Voice Assistant Integration
- **Preconditions**: Microphone and speaker are active.  
- **Triggers**: User says activation keyword (e.g., "Hey Google").  
- **Main Course**: System processes command and executes the requested action.  
- **Alternate Course**: If voice assistant API is offline, provides an error message.  
- **Exception Handling**: Logs errors if command recognition fails.  

### 4.3 UC_003 – Calendar and Reminder System
- **Preconditions**: User has linked their calendar account.  
- **Triggers**: User requests calendar details or system auto-fetches daily schedule.  
- **Main Course**: System retrieves events from Google/Outlook calendar and displays them.
